    VPS - Virtual Private Server

  Create an account on digital ocean.

  Create Droplet
    selected distribution
    $5 a month

  download putty (for windows)
    and download puttygen
      Mac - https://www.puttygen.com/#Download_PuTTYgen_for_Mac

      cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

  Open puttyGen to create a key

  copy the key

  paste into signup page

  save key from puttygen to desktop

  create droplet... now wait



  click on droplet
    shows info
    access - accesses the console
    resize - change the size of droplet
    backup - $1 extra a month to backup
    snapshots - are free

  ssh creditials
    username: root
    auth: ssh-key

  create new user after sshing

  Make user admin
    usermod -aG sudo [username]
    whoami - identifies you

  (ssh key is one line) 

  Remove password login and root login

  Run the node server after installing node, works like it does locally.



  PM2 (runs node app as a service)
    sudo npm install -g pm2

    pm2 start [entry point of app (ex: app.js )]
    pm2 stop [entry point]



  get a new domain. 
    name servers are 
      ns1.digitalocean.com
      ns2.digitalocean.com
      ns3.digitalocean.com


  Change port to port 80 so its not in the browser
    change port in [entry file]
    sudo apt-get install libcap2-bin
    sudo setcap cap_net_blind_service=+ep `readlink -f \`which node\`` 
      binds node service to port 80

    Then run pm2 start [entry point]






deployment with codeup [fernando]

Hi Ceres!

We'll be deploying your Java projects this week, and in order to see your sites live, we'll need to do a couple of things:

Buy a domain name. We recommend namecheap if you don't have a preference, but most registrars should be fine.

Configure the DNS settings for your domain to point to digital ocean for the NS record. If you are using namecheap (other registrars will be similar):

Go to your dashboard and click the "manage" button next to your domain

Under "nameservers", change from "BasicDNS" to "custom"

Enter the following nameservers:

ns1.digitalocean.com
ns2.digitalocean.com
ns3.digitalocean.com
Make sure to click the green check mark to apply the changes

At home, sign up for a digital ocean account. We'll give you a coupon code for $25 credit. If you find other coupon codes on the internet, the code we provide you will probably not work in combination with them. Another option is a $50 referral coupon but it's only valid for 30 days: https://m.do.co/c/606bb30ed8fc

Do Not

Create a droplet on digital ocean, we'll walk through this process together in class.
Buy an ssl/https certificate, we'll be able to get and configure one for free.
The name of the domain you buy is totally up to you, but you should probably keep it professional so that you can show it off to potential employers. (The TLD does not matter either, that is, for the purposes of deploying, example.com, example.org, and example.lol will all work the same.)

The process for changing the DNS records for a domain can potentially take up to 48 hours, which is why it is important to do this ahead of time, we recommend to do this today.

In addition, I'd encourage y'all to give the deployment guide a once over; we'll be following along with it during class.

    larger application for capstone.

  Create a new ssh key

  Add public key

  enable backup for real projects


C-Name record is a 'wildcard'

  Networking[on the left]
    Add the custom domain that you brought
    have to create a A-Record.
      Will be able to respond to the domain and talk to the server

Preparing application
  Create a script to run the application

git hooks
  git push production master
